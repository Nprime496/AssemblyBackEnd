# Assembly IDE Project

_Simulation of a computer functionnment (memories,instructions...) to create a Pseudo-assembly interpreter._

## overview

_This project was made up after attending at a course **(Computer architecture)** in my school **(National advanced school of engineering of Cameroon (Yde))** .In fact,_
_we were taught about assembly through a likely language named "Pseudo-assembly". It was hard to mentally compile all the exercices given_
_and also it was difficult to efficiently test the results._
_Aware of those difficulties, I made this "look like" IDE to help my fellows (and of course myself) with the course.The project was done in_
_a peculiar way as you can see with the simulation of computer's memories (instead of just using better datas structures) because I hope that some of my_
_friends will have fun looking at._
